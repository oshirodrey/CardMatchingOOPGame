# Wow, thing's going better than I expected
>everything up until now still follow the clean architecture (at the very least not breaking it)
and this is very fun to make, as if I'm watching my kid grows(if I ever have one)
>the funniest thing is that I understand what I am doing and will be doing next, that alone make me feel like my effort was worth it
> will come back later to update this.
# next things to add:
* win condition, win screen
* database to make leader board
* sound
* polish the code 
* maybe improve the UI (eye candy ya know)

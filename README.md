# Just a contingency game project for now
I just feel like my current game project (with my team)
gonna goes very bad because the code isn't looking very clean and readable so when there is a bug, as this is copied online, it took a lot of time to figure out.What more diabolical is that we watched the wrong tutorial(watch top-down rpg, make 2d platformer),It make improvising very frustrating,some logic will not work properly unless tunned out very specifically. I'm afraid that when the teacher asks some questions, I'm gonna die standing on that stage, cuz the copied code is the code that is dangerous when explaining 
# bla bla im yapping again, I mean I just want a simple and easy to make game that still apply OOP principles in it thats all
will delete all this frustration later
